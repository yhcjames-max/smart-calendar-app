### **Step 5: Schedule Recommended Sessions**
1. Click **"Schedule This"** on any recommendation
2. The session auto-fills in your main calendar
3. Customize as needed and save

## 🔧 **Advanced Configuration**

You can customize the system behavior by modifying the configuration in the browser console:

```javascript
// Access the scheduler configuration
clientScheduler.config = {
    maxClusterDistance: 5,      // Maximum distance for clustering (km)
    minClientsPerCluster: 2,    // Minimum clients required for a cluster
    maxClientsPerCluster: 6,    // Maximum clients in one cluster
    timeSlotDuration: 60,       // Duration of each time slot (minutes)
    travelBuffer: 30            // Travel buffer between sessions (minutes)
};

// Save the configuration
clientScheduler.saveConfiguration();
```

## 📊 **Understanding the Optimization**

### **Scoring System**
The recommendation engine uses a sophisticated scoring system:

- **Base Score**: +10 points per client in the session
- **Priority Bonus**: 
  - High priority: +5 points
  - Medium priority: +3 points
  - Low priority: +1 point
- **Travel Efficiency**: Lower travel distances = higher scores
- **Time Overlap Quality**: Perfect overlaps score higher than partial ones

### **Distance Calculations**
- Uses the **Haversine formula** for accurate Earth-surface distances
- Accounts for the curvature of the Earth
- Results in kilometers with 2 decimal precision
- Automatic geocoding via **OpenStreetMap Nominatim API**

### **Clustering Algorithm**
- **Proximity-based**: Groups clients within the distance threshold
- **Iterative**: Ensures all clients in a cluster are reasonably close to each other
- **Size-limited**: Respects minimum and maximum cluster sizes
- **Center calculation**: Finds geographic center of each cluster

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Best Results**

### **Client Management**
- ✅ Use **complete addresses** for accurate geocoding
- ✅ Set realistic **availability windows**
- ✅ Use **priority levels** strategically
- ✅ Keep client **preferences updated**

### **Availability Planning**
- 🎯 Add **multiple time slots** per client for flexibility
- ⏰ Use **recurring slots** for regular clients
- 📅 Add **specific dates** for special sessions
- ⭐ Set **high priority** for preferred times

### **Optimization Strategy**
- 🗺️ Group clients by **neighborhood** when possible
- ⏰ Plan sessions during **peak availability** times
- 🚗 Consider **traffic patterns** in your area
